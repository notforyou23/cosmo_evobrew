# Looking for 1–3 co-founders

We are forming a tiny, values-locked company + sibling nonprofit to grow COSMO carefully.

You might be a fit if:
- You immediately grok why drift-bounded consent, schema-gating, and canary releases matter more than benchmarks
- You can help raise or earn the first $1–3 M without giving up control
- You are happy with modest salary + 10-year horizon
